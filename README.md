# Hello World

This is the source code for my blog. This blog uses Gatsby, which is built on top of React.

TODO:
- [] General cleanup -- LESS file structure, get rid of extra fonts/packages
- [] Implement proptypes
- [] Add search bar to all posts
- [] Add content to landing page
- [] Complete design for About and contact pages
- [] Add animations
- [] Make so if no image, gradient is applied (for both header and all-posts)
