# Hello World

This is the source code for a blog template I created called Gatsby Hero. Gatsby is a static site generator built on top of React.

You can view the live deployment here:
https://gatsby-hero.netlify.com/

TODO:
- [] General cleanup -- LESS file structure, get rid of extra fonts/packages
- [] Add form on the contact page and connect it to Netlify
- [] Implement proptypes
- [] Add search bar to all posts
- [] Add content to landing page
- [] Add animations
- [] Make so if no image, gradient is applied (for both header and all-posts)
